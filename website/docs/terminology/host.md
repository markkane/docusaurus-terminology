A host is a person responsible for guests at an event or for providing 
%%hospitality|hospitality%% during it.

The noun host refers to a person who receives and entertains guests at an event, 
providing %%hospitality|hospitality%% during it.

But hosting also has an ickier side: In biology, a host is an animal, plant 
or person that provides a home for another organism â€” like a parasite. 

Host also functions as a noun, meaning a multitude, horde, or great number. 
As in, "You will pick up a host of funky germs from drinking this water."

Also, one more thing: %%dir1 file|dir1file%%
