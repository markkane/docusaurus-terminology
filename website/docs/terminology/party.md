A party is a gathering of people who have been invited by a %%host|host%% for 
the purposes of socializing, conversation, recreation, or as part of a festival 
or other commemoration of a special occasion. 

A party will typically feature food and beverages, and often music and dancing 
or other forms of entertainment. In many Western countries, parties for teens 
and adults are associated with drinking alcohol such as beer, wine etc.

More occasionally (though often in politics), a party can also simply refer to 
a group of people with a common objective.
