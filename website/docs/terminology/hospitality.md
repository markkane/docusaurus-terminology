Hospitality is the relationship between a guest and a %%host|host%%, wherein 
the host receives the guest with goodwill, including the reception and 
entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt 
describes hospitality in the Encyclop√©die as the virtue of a great soul that 
cares for the whole universe through the ties of humanity. 

Hospitality is also the way people treat others, that is the service of 
welcoming receiving guests for example in hotels. Hospitality plays a 
fundamental role to augment or decrease the volume of sales of an organization 
hence every business should master it.

Hospitality ethics is a discipline that studies this usage of hospitality.
