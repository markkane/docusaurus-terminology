## The importance of the host in hospitality

What is a %%host|host%% and why are they so important? Surely someone who just 
meets and greets guests isn’t as essential as a waiter or chef? Think again! 
A host is the first point of call for a guest entering and staying at a 
restaurant – if a guest doesn’t feel welcome they are sure to go elsewhere.

A host is the point person for all tables in a venue. You should know guest’s 
names, moods, and preferences so you can make their experience exceptional. 
You’ll be able to make them feel welcome whether you chat with them on the 
phone or in the restaurant.

Ultimately your job is to represent the %%hospitality|hospitality%% culture of 
your venue and set expectations for your guest. Your days will be long, and 
they will be tiring, but one of the key skills of a host is being able to 
remain calm and friendly no matter the time of day.

Become an expert at making guests feel welcome in this course, perfect for 
anyone who is looking at becoming a leader in their restaurant.
