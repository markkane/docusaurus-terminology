Hospitality is the relationship between a guest and a host, wherein 
the host receives the guest with goodwill, including the reception and 
entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt 
describes hospitality in the Encyclop√©die as the virtue of a great soul that 
cares for the whole universe through the ties of humanity.
